        Rationale
        =========
        
        Most existing Django apps that address the problem of social
        authentication focus on just that. You typically need to integrate
        another app in order to support authentication via a local
        account.
        
        This approach separates the worlds of local and social
        authentication. However, there are common scenarios to be dealt with
        in both worlds. For example, an e-mail address passed along by an
        OpenID provider is not guaranteed to be verified. So, before hooking
        an OpenID account up to a local account the e-mail address must be
        verified. So, e-mail verification needs to be present in both worlds.
        
        Integrating both worlds is quite a tedious process. It is definitely
        not a matter of simply adding one social authentication app, and one
        local account registration app to your `INSTALLED_APPS` list.
        
        This is the reason this project got started -- to offer a fully
        integrated authentication app that allows for both local and social
        authentication, with flows that just work.
